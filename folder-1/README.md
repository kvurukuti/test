# BQaaF Automation

A brief description of what this project does and how shell scripting helps us achieve our goals.

We will perform two tasks for this project.

1. We will Create/Update custom roles in multiple GCP-Projects Individually by reading project Id's from the csv file and attaching that Created custom roles to the Single serviceAccount.

2. Establishing a logsink and attaching it to a dataset that already exists in destination project to route the logs. This is what we'll perform across several GCP-Projects. by reading each project ID from the CSV file individually.




## Uploading automation script files to the gcloud shell using browser.

 1. login to the GCP console and open the cloudshell in the browser.
 2. Upload the automation folder in to the shell as show in the below screenshot.
